          <p>  My name is Maggie Barker.  I grew up in Davis County, UT.  I'm 29 years old and like most millenials, I have an unhealthy commitment to cynicism and cats.  I began coding in high school as a hobby by teaching myself enough HTML and CSS to style my MySpace profile.  After encouragement from my friends already in the industry, I began coding seriously in 2017 and enrolled in the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp with the intention of beginning a new career in web development.

          <p> Since 2015, I have worked at at Discover Financial Services in fraud prevention, detection and analysis.  We're busier than ever since the Equifax breach in July 2017.  My employment background has historically been in customer service and management, which means my skills are in relating to people and getting them to work together.
          </p>
          <p>  I love solving puzzles.  The challenge of encountering a new and different coding problem and the ultimate satisfaction of figuring out the solution is incredibly rewarding.  I am excited to use my newfound skills in a way that benefits my family.
          </p>
          <p>  I have three sisters, six amazing nephews and a niece due in January.  I'm engaged to be married in March and luckily, my sisters have taken on the task of planning my wedding while I'm busy preventing fraud by day and developing my coding skills by night.
